Hi! I'm Raul. 

<p>If you're here, you probably want to know more about me, and I'm happy to ablige.
  I'm currently working as a software developer, but I also have years of experience in Quality Assurance,
  and managing engineering teams.
</p>
<p>I've worked at <a href="https://www.wink.com">Wink</a>, <a href="https://www.ui.com">Ubiquiti Networks</a>,
  and spent four years in the Navy.
  Head over to the resume section for the specifics, or check this New York Times
  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/28/jobs/discipline-detail-and-devices-that-work-they-way-they-should.html">
    article
  </a>.
  When I'm not working or coding, I'm probably reading a book, or watching a superhero movie.
</p>
